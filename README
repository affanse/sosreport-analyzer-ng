sosreport-analyzer-ng

This is the next version of sosreport-analyzer.

You all know that sosreport analyzer includes sar-analyzer.

You have to execute 2 programs, sosreport-analyzer and sar-analyzer.

But, isn't it convenient to execute only one program with config file and get results?

Here, I try to implement the needs above.

This program is in test phase, so, be patient.

Enjoy!
